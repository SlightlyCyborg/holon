<h1>Holon Wizard</h1>

<p>Every thing that you ever have wanted to do, accomplish, achieve, create, or manifest has a specific set of action steps that if taken will result in success</p>
<p>Discovering the set of action steps to take can be challenging. Failure is taking a set of action steps and then realizing they do not achieve the desired result</p>
<p>Failure just means that the wrong set of action steps were taken.</p>
<p>Early on in the development of computers, people realized it was easy for users to fail when creating new objects, such as projects, databases, configurations, pages, etc</p>
<p>The solution to this problem was the program Wizard which everyone who as used a computer is now familiar with.</p>
