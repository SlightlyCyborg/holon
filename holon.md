# Holon

## *Ch 0: Introduction*

Holon is defined by Wikipedia as a [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System) (or [phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon)) that is an [evolving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) [self-organizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoesis) [dissipative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissipative_structure)\[[*citation needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\] [structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure), composed of other holons, whose structures exist at a balance point between [chaos](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chaos) and order. A holon isn't actually "real" in the sense that matter is real. A holon is an abstraction. In programming terms, a Holon is the interface and not the implementation. Machine code is the only form of information that runs on real processors and likewise, matter as bounded packets of energy is the only thing that runs around in the universe and every conceptualization above the quanta is macroscopic "high level code" that predicts how the low level stuff will behave. When the college hippies say "Everything is one man. We are all just endless energy", there is some truth to that. However, when discussing with hippies, it is best to stay away from the concrete details of reality, lest you decide to throw a physics book at them out of anger and of an attempt to break them from their trance like oneness. What the hippies do get that more straitlaced peers overlook is that reality arrives at our perceptions in "packets of understandability". I don't converse with neurons, I converse with humans. China doesn't deal with US citizens in general, but it sure deals with the United States. Each fractal level of reality can be defined by an interface and even though the implementation of that interface consists of layers and layers and layers of abstraction on top of atoms, reality has found it "best" to encapsulate these layers in the same way a programmer encapsulates their data into an object. These objects of reality are what I call "Holons"

The intent of this book is to define the various Holons found in our reality. As I describe the various holons and their interactions in this book, I will link to classes of my Holon codebase written in Java that formally defines the concepts involved. The end result is a coded implementation of my own mental model alongside my description of that model which will be found in this book. I do not intend to make this book too code intensive, but I will insert small snippets of formatted code into the text of this book as I see fit. The goal of the book itself is to describe my formal mental model of reality to any technically minded reader, regardless of their programming experience.  For the more experienced programmers reading this book, I hope you find my codebase to be useful. The code is heavily tailored to my own mental model and may not be suited to your needs, but over the course of this book I think both experienced and non-experienced reader alike will find just how important it is to formally define even the most mundane of concepts in computer code. There were many bugs lurking in my intuitive/unformal understanding of reality that revealed themselves to be patched once they were formally defined in code. If you, the reader, push through this book despite its density, verbosity, and eccentric: in the end I think you will see the power that codifying your mental model brings into your life. Software is truly eating the world.
